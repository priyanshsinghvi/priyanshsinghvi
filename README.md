## 🥘 About Me  

👋 Hi, I'm **@priyanshsinghvi**, a 20-year-old Machine Learning enthusiast who believes both coding and cooking follow the same logic: throw in the right ingredients (data or spices), wait for it to process (train or simmer), and voilà – masterpiece or disaster!  

### Here's what I’m spicing up these days:  
- 👀 **Interests:** ML, AI, Blockchain, and recipes that don’t burn the kitchen.  
- 🌱 **Currently learning:** How to train models and not overcook ideas.  
- 💞️ **Looking to collaborate on:** Projects that mix innovation with fun (bonus if snacks are involved).  
- 📫 **Reach me:** [Email me here](priyanshsinghvi0308@gmail.com) or send a carrier pigeon (results may vary).  
- ⚡ **Fun fact:** My debug process is faster than my onion chopping skills!

## 🧑‍💻 Skills  
- **Programming Languages:** Python, C++, and a pinch of HTML/CSS.  
- **Tech Stack:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, and whatever pairs well with caffeine.  
- **Hobbies:** Binge-watching series, cooking experiments, and breaking down ML models (literally).

## 👨‍🍳 Closing Thought  
“Why settle for just making software intelligent when you can make dinner interesting too?”
