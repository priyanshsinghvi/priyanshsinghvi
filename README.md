## 🧑‍💻 About Me  

👋Hi there! I’m **@priyanshsinghvi**, a 20-year-old Machine Learning enthusiast who’s as passionate about cracking code as I am about perfecting the art of making paneer tikka. My philosophy? Every bug is just a spicy ingredient in the recipe for success.

### 🍳 What’s Cooking in My World?  
- 👀 **Obsessed with:** ML, AI, Blockchain, and finding the perfect pasta-to-sauce ratio.  
- 🌱 **Learning to:** Train neural networks and not overcook ideas.    
- 💞️ **Open to collaborating on:** AI/ML projects, innovative ideas, or anything as exciting as a freshly made pizza.  
- 📫 **How to reach me:** [Shoot me an email](mailto:priyanshsinghvi0308@gmail.com) or send a carrier pigeon (results may vary).    
- ⚡ **Fun fact:** My debug process is faster than my onion chopping skills!

## 🔧 Tech Stack  
**Languages:** Python, C++, and a pinch of HTML/CSS.
**Libraries/Tools:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas and whatever pairs well with caffeine.
**Special Skills:** Breaking things (software, plates, and occasionally my patience) while binge-watching, experimenting in the kitchen, and “debugging” ML models.

## 🥂 Why Follow Me?  
Whether it’s teaching machines how to think or experimenting in the kitchen, I’m all about creating something memorable (or at least edible).
